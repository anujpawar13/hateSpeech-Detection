                <p>Twitter’s mission is to give everyone the power to create and share ideas and information, and to
                    express their opinions and beliefs without barriers. Free expression is a human right – we believe
                    that everyone has a voice, and the right to use it. Our role is to serve the public conversation,
                    which requires representation of a diverse range of perspectives.

                    We recognize that if people experience abuse on Twitter, it can jeopardize their ability to express
                    themselves. Research has shown that some groups of people are disproportionately targeted with abuse
                    online. This includes; women, people of color, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex,
                    asexual individuals, marginalized and historically underrepresented communities. For those who
                    identify with multiple underrepresented groups, abuse may be more common, more severe in nature and
                    more harmful.
